				<p>Ras Muhammad National Park is Egypt’s very first national park, and contains some of the country’s most well-known attractions. Covering roughly 480 square kilometers (around 185 square miles), the park includes shoreline cliffs, tidal flats, deserts, mangrove forests, and Red Sea coral reefs. About 70 percent of its area is marine, and its water supports exceptional biodiversity (Wikimedia Foundation, 2025). Today the park is recognized both for its diverse and dramatic scenery and for its reputation as a common bucket list diving and snorkeling destination.</p>

				<h5>Management</h5>
				<p>Ras Muhammad National Park is run by the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA), particularly by its Nature Conservation Sector and the local Protected Area Management Unit in South Sinai. They work with the South Sinai Governorate, the Tourism Development Authority, and the Ministry of Interior to manage everyday tasks like regulating tourists, monitoring the area, and long-term planning (Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, (n.d.), p. 22).

The park operates under Egypt’s Law 102 of 1983, which requires managers to stop harmful activities, support scientific research, develop conservation programs, educate the public, regulate tourism and recreation, and enforce environmental rules (Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, (n.d.), p. 5).

The park’s funding partially comes from Egypt’s Natural Protectorates Fund. This fund collects money from entrance fees, fines, donations, government support, and grants (Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, (n.d.), p. 7).

Ras Muhammad's management approach includes working with local communities and regional partners. The goal is to protect the park’s ecosystems, reduce conflicts over how the park is used, support sustainable tourism, and prepare for increasing numbers of visitors (Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, (n.d.), p. 4). </p>
