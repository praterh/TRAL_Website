Although it is not an ancient feature (having, ostensibly, been installed after the 1973 October War), it has become a recognizable landmark for visitors entering the park. Many tourists associate it with ideas of strength or spiritual significance, even though its origins are not traditional by nature (Fata, 2024).</p>

These groups historically moved through the region for grazing, fishing, and seasonal travel, leaving behind place names, stories, and resource-use practices that continue to shape the cultural identity of the area (Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, (n.d.), pp. 19, 21, 57).</p>

 Ras Muhammad protects some of the most diverse coral communities in the Red Sea. The park is home to over 200 coral species which, in turn, home thousands of reef fish and invertebrates (Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, (n.d.), pp. 2, 14). Vertical wall reefs, dive sites like Eel Garden, and bays like Old Quay and Marsa Bareika show strong biodiversity and make the park critical for reef conservation.</p>

 Ras Muhammad's seagrass meadows and reefs host many endangered species such as the Hawksbill Sea Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) and the Humphead Wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus) (IUCN, 2025). Its mangrove patches and shallow-water habitats also offer safe zones for young fish and other marine life (Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, (n.d.), p. 14).

 With 119 documented resident and migratory bird species, Ras Muhammad plays an important role in major  migration routes; in just one season, upwards of 275,000 white storks pass through the area(Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, (n.d.), p. 2). Ras Muhammad's coastal lagoons, mangrove forests, and salt flats offer habitats for herons, osprey, storks, and other seabirds.
