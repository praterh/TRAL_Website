				<h5>Who Established Ras Muhammad?</h5>
					<p>Ras Muhammad National Park was created in 1983, making it Egypt’s first national park. It was created by former president Hosny Mubarak, who signed Egypt's Law 102 of 1983. The passing of this law set up Egypt’s protected-area system, established natural protected areas (like Ras Muhammad), and gave the EEAA the authority to manage them (Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, 2006, p. 5). </p>

                                        <p>As Sharm el-Sheikh. which the WikiMedia Foundation describes as "a significant centre in tourism for Egypt", saw a rapid increase of visitation during the late twentieth century, the nearby reefs and coastal landscapes faced threatening new development. To help protect the area, a major improvement program began in 1989 to build necessary facilities and strengthen management (Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, 2006, p. 5).</p>

                        <h5>Past Management Issues and Threats</h5>
				<p>Ras Muhammad has faced several major environmental challenges that affected its lands. In 1996, a flood swept large amounts of sediment into ecologically-valuable reef areas, smothering corals and lowering species diversity (Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, 2006, p. 21). One of the most serious issues in Ras Muhammad's history was a crown-of-thorns starfish outbreak from 1998 to 2001. This starfish was not invasive, but still incredibly venomous, and its outbreak greatly reduced coral cover and reproduction. To combat this issue, park rangers and local diving centers removed more than 120,000 starfish to help reefs recover (Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, 2006, p. 21).</p>

			<h5>Former Occupation of the Area</h5>
                        <p>Before Ras Muhammad was established as a national park, the area was used by Bedouin communities who moved through the region for grazing and fishing (Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, 2006, p. 19). There were no permanent settlements within park boundaries, but the land was part of the cultural landscape of eight Bedouin tribes living throughout South Sinai. Bedouin customs emphasized environmental respect; for example, tribal law strictly prohibited cutting down live green trees (Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, 2006, p.21). These traditions show strong and long-standing cultural ties to the land and a conservation ethic in the Bedouin peoples that took place before modern park management.</p>
