                        	<p>There are no permanent residents living in Ras Muhammad National Park, but the surrounding are continues to be used by local Bedouin communities. Today, Bedouin families use nearby wadis for small-scale grazing and seasonal movement, just as they did before the establishment of the park (Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, 2006, p. 19). Their activities inside the park itself are restricted to protect its most sensitive habitats, but their presence in the surrounding landscape remains an important part of the cultural identity of the area.</p>

                        	<h5>Management Issues and Threats</h5>
                        	<p>Heavy visitation has recently become a main challenge of the area; divers, snorkelers, and boat traffic can damage coral by breaking branches, creating shade, dropping anchors, or polluting the waters (Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, 2006, p. 20). Natural activity also continues to play a role: storms and sediment hurt the reefs just as they did before (Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, 2006, pp. 21). Pollution from the rapid development in Sharm el-Sheikh and the threat of oil spills from regional shipping routes remain ongoing risks. There have already been two major oil-related accidents in the last ten years (Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, 2006, p. 58). On land, issues such as plastic waste from tour boats and illegal fish feeding add strain to the ecosystem (Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, 2006, p. 57). To manage these threats, park staff employ strategies such as zoning, mooring buoys, ranger patrols, and continuous monitoring to maintain the ever-difficult balance of tourism access and the need to protect the area.</p>
